# Fog Project <img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="http://shop.johannesfog.dk/gfx/foglogok.png">
This is project made by [5 students](https://github.com/Steingrimurjonsson/FogProjekt#authors) from Copenhagen Business Academy on 2nd semester 

## The Task

Working in groups and using Scrum as the process model, you must develop major parts of a multi-user database application.

The project constitutes the formal basis for the exam on 2nd semester.

The constraints on your work can be summarized in a set of requirements regarding:

what you have to develop (the product)
how you have to work (the process)
what you must hand in or demonstrate (the documentation).

## Product requirements

The case you work with is the Fog-case, which was presented by Fog. Further documentation can be found in the project folder on github.

You must develop and (partly) test a system that meets (parts of) the needs of the customer.

Note that the requirements may be subject to changes and “clarifications” during the project period.

The solution must respect the following set of technical and design related constraints:

* It must use a MySQL database.

* The design must reflect a logical multilayer architecture running on a Java server.

* Your application must use both plain java classes, servlets and JSP’s.

* The web page must be usable in either Chrome or Firefox.

* The developed application must be deployed in the cloud (e.g. Digital Ocean).

* The source code must be available in a github repository.

* The Javadoc should be available online put link on front page of reports.
